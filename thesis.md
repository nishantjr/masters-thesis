# Introduction

* What is SMT?
* Why do we need SMT?
* Solvers: Theory specific, generalization, composition.
* The Nelson-Oppen Combination procedure
* Nelson Oppen in ordered sorted logics

# Preliminaries: Rewriting Logic & Maude

* What is rewriting?
* vs Lambda Calculus based functional programming
* Maude functional modules in a mathematical sense
  * Confluence 
  * ...

* Maude quickstart
  * Meta Level and reflection

## Decision Procedures in Maude

### CVC4

### Variant Satisfiability

Note on var-sat and countably infinite sorts

# Order Sorted Nelson Oppen as a rewrite theory (CS576 notes)

## Convex vs non-convex

## Inference System

# Order Sorted Nelson-Oppen in Maude's META-LEVEL

# Examples

* Hereditarily finite sets + Rats 
* Integrating with ctor variants from var-sat
